                                We sometimes get asked what the main differences are between values and personality. In short, personality represents our patterns of thinking and feeling (with no judgement involved) whereas values represent what we believe to be right. They are deeply held principles that guide our choices and influence our emotions.
                                Most people will be more familiar with tools that compare our personality as they have become common practice in the recruitment across a variety of industries. Yet some of the most popular tools such as Myers Briggs have been subject recently to more scrutiny. A well researched piece in the Financial Times and this piece by Adam Grant point out that the research behind the Big Five personality indicators is significantly more robust than Myers Briggs. The evidence behind the Big Five is why we use it as the basis for our reports.
